                <p>Enthusiastic and motivated Software Engineer with a keen interest in Computing. With a strong drive to solve complex problems with technology in order to make a real value-added impact on users in a SaaS environment, I have a creative mindset and keen to collaborate with others in order to innovate.

            For me, programming is a very powerful modern art just like any other art: painting, music or poetry. It’s a tool for
            
            your brain. It’s a freedom, anyone can give life to their ideas with the help of programming. The pleasure of making
            
            things that are useful to other people.
            
            I am excited by the challenges found in working on complex real-world problems, which can affect many customers/users and on a global scale. I am highly logical and detail-oriented and passionate about continuous learning and development.
            
            When you work on the electronic field you have to be very accurate, detail focussed, organised and flexible person. I think, that my previous experience will allow me to easily become a valuable part of a development team.</p>

            <p>For me, programming is a very powerful modern art just like any other art: painting, music or poetry. It’s a tool for your brain. It’s a freedom, anyone can give life to their ideas with the help of programming. The pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. If you're a developer, your fate is in your hands. If you want something built, you can do it yourself. It's a powerful feeling. Normal people have two categories of things: things they know and things they don't know. Developers have a slightly different set of things: things they know and things they don't know but they can use Google to figure it out. I try to improve my coding knowledge every day and every day I realise how much I do not know yet. This feeling gives me the motivation to work harder.</p>
            <p>I like to do front-end. I believe that the main reason is that front-end development satisfies my need for creativity. It enabled me to easily put my ideas into digital form and get results back really quick. I still remember the first time I created an HTML page and opened it in the browser. A whole new world of possibilities appeared before my eyes. I am a person how doesn’t like to change a job every year (as you can see that from my CV). In the future I would like to be a full stack developer working for the same company but I wouldn’t like to have a job where I have to do the same things over the years.</p>
